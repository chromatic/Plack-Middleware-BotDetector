    enable 'Plack::Middleware::BotDetector',
        bot_regex => qr/Googlebot|Baiduspider|Yahoo! Slurp/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any popular web site will get a tremendous amount of traffic from bots,
spiders, and other automated processes. Sometimes you want to do (or not do)
things when such a request comes in--for example, you may not want to log bot
traffic on your site.

This middleware applies an arbitrary, user-supplied regex to incoming requests
and sets a key in the PSGI environment if the user agent of the request
matches. Any other portion of your app which understands PSGI can examine the
environment for this key to take appropriate actions.
